# Blender-Prepare-for-Export
Simple addon that runs all the usual checks to make sure your models behaving correctly. Made explicitly to save time running some simple operations most every Blender user runs thousands of times. I originally made this to speed up my process exporting to Unity, and figured y'all might get use out of it too ^-^

Full List:
- Applies:
  - Scale
  - Transformation
  - Rotation
- Resets:
  - Origin*
    - Double check your origin. Wonky, as Blender tends to be.    
  - Normals
