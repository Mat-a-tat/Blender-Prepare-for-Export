# Blender-Prepare-for-Export
Simple addon that runs all the usual checks to make sure your models behaving correctly. Made explicitly to save time running some simple operations most every Blender user runs thousands of times. I originally made this to speed up my process exporting to Unity, and figured y'all might get use out of it too ^-^

=====================

Instaliation: 

As normal for addons
1) Download the .py
2) Open up a fresh project
3) Prefernces
4) Install Addon
5) Install 'Blender Prepare for Export'
6) Navigate to the slected on in the add on menues (If Blenders being rude.) 
7) In the top right of the viewport, under Tools, should be that magical lil' prepare for export button. 
8) Profit! (hopefully)
